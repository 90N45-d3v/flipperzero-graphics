 Collection of graphics I made for the Flipper Zero.
 <br>
 Over time I will continue to create new graphics and add them here.

<h2>Animations</h2>
<h4>Want to include these animations into an asset pack for usage on your Flipper?</h4>

1. Create an empty folder with the name you want your asset pack to have on your flipper at `SD Card/asset_packs/`
2. Create an empty folder with the name `Anims` on your flipper at `SD Card/asset_packs/<Folder from 1.>/`
3. Create a file called `manifest.txt` in the `Anims` folder with the following text in the beginning:
```
Filetype: Flipper Animation Manifest
Version: 1
```
4. Append the following text for each animation you want to have in the asset pack
```
Name: <Animation's name (ex. DEDSEC)>
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 18
Min level: 1
Max level: 30
Weight: 3
```
5. Upload the animations folders onto your flipper at `SD Card/asset_packs/<Folder from 1.>/Anims/`
